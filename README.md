# Final-Year-Thesis on Anderson Localization
Numerical simulations of Anderson transition studied using different quantifiable quantities including gap ratio, spectral form factor, entanglement entropy, etc.
Models considered are tight binded Hamiltonians 1-D lattice, 3-D cube, Cayley tree, and long range hopping models which are studied to varying extents.
NOTE: This repo is basically a dump of all the work I did during my final year and hence somethings might not be perfected/unoptimized/unorganized or incomplete.
